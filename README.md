# Spert Chess
## Play chess
* An application to play chess on Windows systems
* No need to install it in a chess GUI, as it has its own
* You can download it from the release section, extract and run
* On 32-bit systems only "Spert x86" executable will work
* For 64-bit systems I recomend "Spert" executable, it is faster
* I built it for Windows 10 OS, and it can also be run on Windows 10 and Windows 7
* The engine is not strong, so it is suitable for casual games
* No time management, it only uses depth search
* You can choose game speed: rapid, normal or slow
* No game saving, but you can save current position and reload it at a later time
* Has its own opening book, not a large one, as I made it manually

##

* It has its own Graphical User Interface, as I wanted to deliver something easy to use for anyone
* It does not have a strong engine, so it is
