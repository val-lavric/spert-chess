# Spert Chess

![Alt text](https://github.com/val-lavric/spert-chess/blob/main/screenshot.png)

## What it is made for

* An application for playing chess on Windows PC

* No need to install it in a chess GUI, it has its own

* You can download it from the release section, extract and run

* On 32-bit systems, only "Spert x86" executable will work

* For 64-bit systems I recommend "Spert" executable, it is faster

* I built it for Windows 10 OS, and it can also be run on Windows 11 and Windows 7

* The engine is not very strong, so it is suitable for casual games

* No time management, it only uses depth search

* You can choose game speed: rapid, normal or slow

* You can save current position and reload it at a later time, no whole game saving

* Has its own opening book

## How it was made

* I made Spert Chess as a personal project while learning to program and from love for chess

* What tools I used
  
  * Programming language: C++ (ISO C++ 14)

  * GUI library: wxWidgets (version 3.2.4)

  * IDE software: Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.11.3)
